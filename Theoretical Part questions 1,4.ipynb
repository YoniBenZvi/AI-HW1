    "a. From the fact that h is admissible then $\\forall s\\in S$ such that $Applicable_h (s)$ is True , $h_0(h,s)=h(s)\\leq h^*(s)$. In addition, $\\forall s\\in S$ such that $Applicable_h (s)$ is False , $h_0(h,s)=0 \\leq h^*(s)$ because the price function is bounded from below by $\\delta>0$ so $h^*(s)\\geq 0, \\forall s\\in S$. From that we conclude $h_0$ is also admissible    "

    "From the fact that $h'(s_0)$ is given ($s_0$ is the start state) and equals $h^*(s_0)$, then we can use DFS-L with depth of $h'(s_0)$ and the heuristic $h_0(h',s)$ for choosing next node from $succ(s)$ in each iteration. the algorithm in this case is admissible because it is given in the question that there exist a solution with depth of $h'(s_0)$ and it is optimal, so the algorithm will find such a solution necessarily, as we learned for DFS-L. \n",

    "explanation why the run time of the algorithm is bounded above by $A^*$: If v is a node/state that the DFS-L algorithm (with $h'(s_0)$ depth as input and the heuristic $h_0(h',s)$) has developed then it means that $L(v) \\leq h^*(s_0)$ and because of that the $A^*$ algorithm with the same heuristic will also develope v by the way $A^*$ is defined (plus the assumption on the heritage order in the question). In addition, DFS-L algorithm will develope v excactly one time because the graph is a tree and this is not necessarily true for $A^*$. The conclusion from the explantions is that the algorithm's run time is bounded from above by $A^*$ run time with the same $h_0(h',s)$ heuristic as we claimed"
