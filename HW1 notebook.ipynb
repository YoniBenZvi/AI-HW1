This is the maximal number of vertices it can be connected to using the operators defined in the exercise. <br> <br>\n",

    "Yes. Consider a graph that contains two gas station vertices $f_1,f_2$ that are connected to each other, and the distance between them is less than the maximal distance the scooter can go when its fuel tank is full. Suppose the scooter is currently at $f_1$. Therefore, its fuel tank is full. Let us denote this state as $S_1$. Suppose it chooses to go to $f_2$. Once it arrives at $f_2$, its fuel level is once again full. Lastly, suppose the scooter chooses to go back to $f_1$. Once it arrives there (for the second time), its fuel capacity is once again full. Note that the current state is identical to $S_1$, as The sets $T,F$ have not changed during this path's traversal, and the fuel levels were constant. Therefore, we have found a directed cycle in the graph."

Hence, we can count this state only once.<br>\n",

    "If we ignore the fuel constraint and assume that $d_0$ is very big such that the scooter does not need to refuel during its trip, the goal state minimal depth must be at least the number of delivery drop-off points $k$, as the scooter must go through all of them to get to a goal state. If we reconsider the fuel constraint, each refuel operation adds one level of depth to the search, hence increasing the depth. Therefore, the minimal depth is $k$."
